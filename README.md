# crispy-eureka
This is a tic-tac-toe game made in javascript. Why is it called "Crispy Eureka"? Because Git Hub suggested it and I liked it! Feel free to check out my code and play the game all you like. When it's finished that is.

Here's a checklist of things to do: 

1. Make a grid thingie with game field. Something similar to my sketchbook project will do. https://memorydreams.github.io/sketchbook/; 
2. Make it possible to set crosses and zeroes on grid cells.
3. Make a system to check if there are three crosses or zeroes in a row.
4. Make an AI option.
